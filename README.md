# lab-work-5
This module contains classes for working with geometric figures in two-dimensional space.
We set the points, sort them by X and Y, find the perimeter and the largest diagonal

Create a class Point(x, y). Create a class Polynom whose points (any number) are Point objects.
Add enum color: RED, GREEN, BLUE, ... Add a function to determine the perimeter, the longest diagonal and output their lengths. 
Define functions for sorting points on abscissa(x) and ordinate(y)
